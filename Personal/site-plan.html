      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The Sacrament Program page will be the main landing page.  This page will allow the members from the ward arrive at this home page to see Sacrament Program for the week.  Which will include the speakers, songs, prayers, and general announcements for each Sunday.  In addition, this website will allow members the ability to see each of the different auxiliary groupâ€™s activities and lessons for the month through the additional pages on the website.  The general idea is to allow a single location for the ward members to get information.  Not all users use the same means of communication, some like text, some like Facebook, others like email.  Having a centralized website for the sacrament program and links to the different activities allows members to have a single location for communication.  The main page will have the following items:
        <br><br>Title: Sacrament Meeting Program 
        <br>Date:
        <br>Presiding: 
        <br>Conducting: 
        <br>Pianist:
        <br>Chorister:
        <br>*Announcements*
        <br>Opening Hymn:
        <br>Invocation
        <br> *Ward Business*
        <br>Sacrament Hymn:
        <br> *Administration of the Sacrament*
        <br>Speaker:
        <br>Speaker:
        <br>Intermediate Hymn:
        <br>Speaker:
        <br>Closing Hymn:
        <br>Benediction 
        <br><br>Subtitle: Classes (2nd Hour)
        <br><br>The Classes area will display the classes and times for each of the odd and even weeks for each class.  This will help individuals remember what class meets during the week.  Individuals are still getting used to only having a two-hour block and often ask each other which class we are having today. In the example below the page will display the odd and even weeks and the classes that happen during that time.
        <br>Example:
        <br>1st and 3rd Sundays: Sunday School (10:30 am)
        <br>2nd and 4th Sundays: Priesthood, Relief Society, Young Women's (10:30 am) 
        <br>Every Sunday: Primary (10:30 am)

        <br><br>Subtitle: Ward Announcements: 
        <br><br>This area will display specific ward announcements for the day.  For example, if the Sunday School Presidency calls for a Teacher Council.  This part of the website will display that information to help individuals remember to attend the class that day. 
        <br>Example:  Teacher Council for auxiliaries will be held today during the 2nd hour in the overflow.  5Th Sunday lesson will be held in the overflow area for Young Men and Young Women.  Elders Quorum and Relief Society will meet in the Relief Society room during the 2nd hour block.

      </ul>
      <h3>Activities</h3>
      <p>
        On the activities page, members will be able to see six different areas of the ward.  
        Relief Society, Elders Quorum, Young Women, Young Men, Primary, Ward and if there are specific activities for each of those areas.  
        The Relief Society can see the monthly activities, or spiritual thought that the Relief Society wants to share.  
        The Elders Quorum can see if there are service activities, camping or sporting activities.   
        Young Men and Young Women will allow each group to give specific information about the activities for the week for the given age groups.  
        Members will be able to see the talks and lessons each Sunday, so they can come prepared to learn and contribute to the lesson.

      </ul>
      <h3>Resources</h3>
      <p>
        The resources page will allow members to see how to schedule an appointment with the bishop, schedule stake temple recommends or who they need to contact to update the bulletin.  In addition, this page will have the information that is required for new member move ins to allow the ward clerk to transfer records. 
        The purpose of this page will be for information purposes only and will not contain locations or address information but more of a general talking point for each of the auxiliary members.  The only phone numbers/email or link that will be shared on this site are the links to the bishop and stake presidency for appointments.  
        This will also note that this website is not an official church website.
